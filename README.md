# Introduction to HTML and CSS

**HTML** and **CSS** are two of the *building blocks* of Web Development.

**HTML** (*HyperText Markup Language*)<br>
A fundamental **markup language** that determines the **structure** and **content** of a web page.<br>
This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia.<br>
It is able to create: paragraphs, lists, headings, layout, links, multimedia players, forms, tables and many more elements.

**CSS** (*Cascading Style Sheets*)<br>
Popular **style sheet language** used for specifying **styling** and **presentation** of a document written in a **markup language** as HTML.<br>
Used to style the content of a web page, it lets developers control the visual appearance of websites through typographic characteristics, colour properties, and overall layout of web pages.

**The relation between HTML and CSS** is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

In simple words:<br>
**HTML** provides **structure** and **meaning** to the web page<br>
**CSS** allows to precisely **style** it


## In-depth

**Hypertext**<br>
Text (often with embeds such as images, too) displayed on a web page or in a document which contains links to other information, making it possible **to navigate between different content** in a nonlinear way.<br>

**Markup language**<br>
A system that defines a set of rules on **how the structure and presentation of content should appear** in a digital document.It allows document formatting, data storage, and specifying how different elements should be displayed (or “rendered”) on web pages; it helps to easily format websites to make them accessible to users. Its main job is to make everything readable for humans.<br>
**Markup** is a term originated from traditional publishing practices, where editors would mark manuscripts with annotations or corrections.<br>
In digital contexts, **markup languages** supply a similar function, with “marking up” done through the use of tags. These tags provide computers with instructions on how to interpret and display the content.

**Programming language**<br>
Formal language containing a set of instructions, written by programmers, that **enables humans to communicate with computers**, creating the technology we use every day; telling them what to do, computers are able to perform and accomplish tasks and get the desired outputs.<br>Like spoken languages, each language has its own unique syntax, structure, vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.
These languages enable us to build, organize and share code, process large amounts of data, specify functionality and behavior, automate and improve efficiency, and solve problems creatively.

**Cascading**<br>
In web development this word refers to **how styles are applied to HTML elements**; a top-down definition of styles where newer styles override previous styles.<br>
CSS rules can be defined in multiple places (inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets) so the term “cascading” highlights how CSS applies a hierarchy of rules, where certain rules take precedence over others based on defined principles.

**CSS Cascading order precedence** from highest priority to lowest one:

**Inline CSS >  Internal CSS > External CSS > Browser Default/User Styles**

**Style sheet language**<br>
It's a computer language that **describes the appearance and layout** of a web page written in HTML. It contains the style rules that determine how elements on the page should be displayed.
