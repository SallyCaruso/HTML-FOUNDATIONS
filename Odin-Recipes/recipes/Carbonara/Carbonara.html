  <h1>The Authenthic Carbonara Romana</h1>

  <img src="../images/carbonara.jpg">

  <p>
    A typical dish from the stunning Eternal City of <strong>Roma</strong>, appreciated all over the World.<br>
    Based on pasta, eggs, guanciale and pecorino cheese is a simple dish, but heavenly good!<br>
    <br>
    <strong>The spaghetti secret revealed:</strong> Italy has more than 300 different kind of pasta.
    Long pasta is made to be cooked in its <em>natural shape</em> as the long tube allows the sauce to stick.
    Once placed in the pot, the spaghetti is simply <strong>lowered slowly with a fork</strong>. <em>Easy!</em>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
    <li>Guanciale thickly cut - <em>(type of Italian cured pork with a high-quality fat component)</em></li>
    <li>2-3 egg yolks</li>
    <li>Pecorino romano cheese</li>
    <li>About 1 tablespoon of pasta cooking water</li>
    <li>Black pepper and salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      First of all, cut the guanciale into squares and place it in the pan, 
      then place a large pot with water on the stove in order to boil it.
    </li><br>
    <li>
      At the same time, heat the guanciale in the pan over a gentle heat.
      The guanciale should not harden by frying too much, but should soften gently,
      releasing all the "fat" it will need to sauté the spaghetti (t will takes about 2 minutes).
      In the meantime the water will have come to the boil: throw a bit less than a handful of rock salt
      first, then the spaghetti.<br>
      <br>
      <em>
        - <strong>Boiling water for pasta:</strong> the correct amount of rock salt is tipically a handful;
        in this specific case, as carbonara is particularly salty is recommended to put a pinch less -<br>
      </em>
      <em>
        - <strong>Al dente:</strong> to be "al dente" it must first be 100 % Italian pasta than follow
        the cooking time on the packet, usually subtracting 1½ to 2 minutes from the cooking time -
      </em>

    <li>
      The way to make the egg yolk cream for a perfect carbonara:
      mix the egg yolks with most of the pecorino cheese (leave 1 teaspoon for the seasoning) and pepper.
      Add 1 tablespoon of pasta cooking water to avoid an omelette effect.
      The cream must be soft, but at the same time full-bodied and velvety.<br>
      The colour should be intense and not too pale.
    </li><br>   
    <li>
      Drain the spaghetti "al dente" directly into the hot pan with the guanciale (keeping the cooking water to one side).
      Then add 2 - 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Stir everything together for 1 minute over a high heat.
      Finally turn off the heat, remove the pan from the hob and pour the egg yolk cream over the spaghetti.
      Stir for a few seconds, add pecorino cheese, 1 - 2 tablespoons of boiling cooking water to promote creaminess and pepper!
